# Streamlit Clustering Application

This Streamlit application allows you to explore different clustering models on the Iris dataset.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed.
2. Install dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the application with the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Features

### Data Selection

- Choose a dimensionality reduction method from PCA, Truncated SVD, and Factor Analysis.
- Visualize the dimensionality reduction graph.

### Model

- Select a clustering model from KMeans and DBScan.
- Visualize the clustering graph on the reduced dataset.

### Evaluation

- Display the confusion matrix and classification report of the selected clustering model.

## Usage

1. Start by exploring the Data Selection section to choose the dimensionality reduction method and visualize the graph.
2. Move to the Model section to choose the clustering model and visualize the clustering graph.
3. To evaluate the model's performance, navigate to the Evaluation section.

Note: Make sure to follow these steps in the indicated order.
